abstract: Heavy neutral leptons (HNLs) are an attractive minimal extension of the Standard Model, as is a singlet scalar ùë† mixing with the Higgs boson. If both are present, it is natural for HNLs to interact with ùë†. For a light singlet, the decay ùëÅ ‚Üíùë†‚Å¢ùúà can dominate over weak HNL decays. We reinterpret existing constraints on HNL mixing from the DELPHI, CHARM, and Belle experiments for 0.5‚Äì100 GeV mass HNLs, taking into account the new decay channel. Although the constraints are typically weakened, in some cases they can become stronger, due to observable ùë† ‚Üí‚Ñì+‚Å¢‚Ñì‚àí decays in the detectors. The method presented here could be used to recast constraints from other (older) experiments without resorting to computationally expensive Monte Carlo simulations. In addition, we update and correct some errors in the analysis of the original constraints, in the absence of the singlet.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Heavy Neutral Leptons (HNLs) in the MeV‚ÄìGeV range offer a natural mechanism to account for the smallness of active neutrino masses through mixing. Existing bounds on the active‚Äìsterile mixing parameters, derived from beam-dump experiments and collider searches, are typically quoted under the assumption of minimal HNL interactions. These constraints, however, cannot be straightforwardly applied when HNLs couple to a light singlet scalar that mixes with the Higgs boson, since such interactions modify decay channels and detector event rates. We therefore provide a reinterpretation of the limits from DELPHI, Belle, and CHARM in this extended framework.
