abstract: Using 14 years of Fermi-LAT data and 10 years of H.E.S.S. observations in the direction of the galactic center, we derive limits on gamma-ray lines originated from dark matter annihilations for fermionic and scalar fields. We describe the dark matter annihilation into γγ or γZ final states in terms of effective operators and place limits on the energy scale as a function of the dark matter mass, taking into account the energy resolution of the instruments. For the Fermi-LAT data, we considered an NFW and a contracted NFW dark matter density profile, the latter being preferred by the Fermi GeV excess. For the H.E.S.S. observation, we used NFW and Einasto profiles. Fermi-LAT yields the most stringent constraints for dark matter masses below 300 GeV, whereas H.E.S.S. has the strongest ones for dark matter masses above 1 TeV. The telescopes share similar sensitivities for dark matter masses between 300 GeV and 1 TeV. We conclude that Fermi-LAT (H.E.S.S.) can probe energy scales up to 10(20) TeV for scalar and fermionic dark matter particles.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: We derive the sensitivity of the Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT) for observing gamma-ray lines resulting from dark matter annihilations. We focus on photon-photon and photon-Z lines. We carry this analysis both for scalar and fermion dark matter using the lowest-order effective operators, namely dimension six and five, respectively. We place limits on the effective energy scale for different dark matter masses taking into account the angular and energy resolution of Fermi-LAT.
