summary: Public lecture delivered at the National University of Engineering (UNI)
abstract: 'Two of humanity’s greatest scientific achievements - General Relativity and the Standard Model of Particle Physics - come together to form the Standard Model of Cosmology. A striking outcome of this framework is that most of the energy content of the universe is not in the form of ordinary matter, but rather dark matter and dark energy. In this talk, I will focus on the case for dark matter, reviewing the key astrophysical and cosmological evidences that point to its existence.'
